About the project: Our project is about retrieving the political news documents. We have crawled the dataset and retrieved the documents by the query and also ranking the documents 
                   along with the evaluation of the IR system

 
Steps to run the project : 

                       1. download the data set and the required files form the drive link below
                             
                             https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i_fxrT8yupNbRkpJ4lpvy5n9liP2YgYK?usp=sharing


                       2. after downloading the data set run the ranking.py this will ask user for the query and enter the query and also query number

 
                        3. For evaluation run the evaluation.py file this will print the recall and the precision and also P-R curve




Note: Make sure the entire data set is one folder and remaining files(required .json files and code) in one directory(no need to create seperate folder)
